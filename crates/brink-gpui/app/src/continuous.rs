//! The **Continuous view** — the project as one manuscript.
//!
//! Every file in binder order in a single scroller, a heading between each,
//! scrolling straight through the boundaries
//! (`packages/studio-shell/src/continuous-view.tsx`, ruled 2026-08-26).
//!
//! ## Stacked, not concatenated — and why that survives the port
//!
//! The studio's ruling is that the view is a STACK of per-file documents,
//! not one synthetic buffer: each file keeps its own document handle, so
//! diagnostics, semantic tokens and completion stay per-file and correct.
//! The alternative needs span translation across the entire IDE surface.
//!
//! Nothing about GPUI changes that. Zed *does* have the concatenated answer
//! — `crates/multi_buffer`, which is what its project-search and diagnostics
//! views scroll through — but that is **17,589 lines** wired into Zed's own
//! buffer/language stack, not something `gpui-component`'s editor can be
//! pointed at. Writing our own lands back on the 2026-08-26 objection.
//!
//! ## The one real problem the stack introduces
//!
//! `gpui-base`'s editor computes its visible line range from **its own
//! height** (`element.rs`: `viewport_bottom = viewport_top + input_height`).
//! An editor sized to its content therefore has no viewport smaller than
//! itself, and lays out EVERY line it holds. Stack 44 of those and the whole
//! project lays out on every frame.
//!
//! So the stack is virtualised at the FILE level: GPUI's `list` element
//! (variable-height, unlike `uniform_list`) mounts only the sections near the
//! viewport. Off-screen files cost nothing; on-screen files lay out in full,
//! which is the honest residual cost of a stacked manuscript.
