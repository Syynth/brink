// path — the Workflow tool's `args` reaches scripts unparsed in this build,
// so an args-reading fallback just wastes a launch. Adapt prompts to the
// project, but keep the quality steps (reachability proof, conventions lint,
// adversarial review, serial merge, no-silent-drops reconciliation).
//
// Flow: PER-ITEM PIPELINE (v3 — no head-of-line blocking): each issue runs
// build -> review -> land INDEPENDENTLY; a finished build goes straight to ITS
// adversarial review while slower siblings keep building. The ONLY
// serialization is the TRAIN QUEUE: merge/fix agents share one persistent
// train worktree and each merge advances main, so landings run one-at-a-time
// in COMPLETION order. Lessons + scope reconciliation close the wave.

const DISK = `PRE-FLIGHT: run \`df -h /\` FIRST — if free space is under 15GiB, STOP and return ok:false with reason "ENOSPC risk" instead of building (a full wave of worktrees on a near-full disk killed every agent at once; other repos' sessions share this disk, so never assume yesterday's free space). WORKTREE ECONOMY: don't cold-install. If the primary checkout's node_modules matches your lockfile, clone it into the worktree first (macOS/APFS: \`cp -c -R <primary>/node_modules ./node_modules\`; Linux: \`cp --reflink=auto -R\` or \`cp -al\`), then let the install command true it up (near-instant). Always run gates with the shared cache prefix so sibling agents' builds become cache hits.
⚠ NEVER \`git stash\` — all worktrees share ONE stash stack, so a sibling agent can pop YOUR work-in-progress (this has happened). To set WIP aside, commit it to your own branch and amend/reset later.`;

// ⚠ ONE train worktree PER WAVE: suffix the path uniquely for THIS wave (e.g.
// /tmp/pump-merge-train-t8). CONCURRENT waves sharing one path race the same
// `train-pr` branch and have SILENTLY DROPPED files from merge trees (caught
// twice, by luck, in gate diffs). The persistence win is per-wave node_modules
// reuse — it never required cross-wave sharing.
const TRAIN_WT = "/tmp/pump-merge-train-FILL-UNIQUE-SUFFIX";
const TRAIN_SETUP = `TRAIN WORKTREE — MANDATORY STEP 0, before ANY other git command: your shell starts in the USER'S ACTIVE worktree; running checkout/reset/merge there DESTROYS their in-progress work (this has happened MORE THAN ONCE — cd alone has proven insufficient because shell state resets between Bash calls). RULES: (1) \`cd ${TRAIN_WT}\` first (if absent, create it with \`git worktree add ${TRAIN_WT} --detach origin/main\` from the primary checkout, then cd); (2) EVERY git command you run for the rest of this task MUST be spelled \`git -C ${TRAIN_WT} …\` — the -C flag is not optional, even right after a cd, even for status/log; a bare \`git checkout\` in the wrong cwd is how user work gets destroyed; (3) non-git commands (pnpm, gh) must be prefixed with \`cd ${TRAIN_WT} && \` in the same Bash invocation. Start clean: \`git -C ${TRAIN_WT} fetch origin --quiet && git -C ${TRAIN_WT} checkout --detach origin/main && git -C ${TRAIN_WT} reset --hard && git -C ${TRAIN_WT} clean -fd\`. node_modules persists across train stops — that's the point.
⚠ ${TRAIN_WT} is the ONLY worktree you may use. NEVER use, cd into, or run git against ANY path under .claude/worktrees/ or any other "already provisioned" worktree you discover — those are the USER'S live sessions (an agent that migrated to one hijacked a dev server mid-drive and left it detached). If ${TRAIN_WT} looks contended or its state looks wrong (unexpected branch tip, files missing after a merge), do NOT relocate: re-verify against the PR head SHA via gh, recreate ${TRAIN_WT} from scratch, or return merged:false with the reason. After ANY merge, verify the PR's changed files are all present in the tree (git -C ${TRAIN_WT} diff --stat origin/main) before gating — a raced checkout can drop files with no conflict marker.`;

${DISK}
STEPS (Bash):
1. ${closesList(b).map((x) => `\`gh issue view ${x} --repo ${REPO}\``).join(" + ")} — read full scope + acceptance.
2. \`git fetch origin --quiet && git checkout -B auto/issue-${b.n} origin/main\`. Clone node_modules per WORKTREE ECONOMY, then install + build shared/workspace deps FIRST (consumers resolve built deps from dist).
3. Implement TDD. SCOPE DISCIPLINE: your own new files + minimal wiring; avoid shared hot files unless the hint names them; if you must touch one, make a minimal additive change so sibling PRs merge cleanly.
4. PROVE REACHABILITY: confirm the change is actually reached by a user (wired into the UI / called), not just covered by a unit test. State the exact user path in \`reachability\`. Dead/unwired code is a FAIL.
5. CONVENTIONS LINT: no invented identifiers/tokens — grep new design tokens etc. against the real source of truth; honor house rules.
6. Run the GATE to GREEN: \`${gateFor(b)}\`. Capture counts.
7. VERIFY THE DIFF IS REAL: \`git diff origin/main --stat\` must be NON-EMPTY and match what you believe you built — an empty diff means your edits didn't land (wrong cwd/worktree); STOP and fix rather than opening a hollow PR (one shipped with a fully fabricated body and was caught by review — an instant reject and a wasted cycle). Then stage explicit paths (NOT git add -A), commit (end the message with "${TRAILER}"), \`git push -u origin auto/issue-${b.n}\`.
8. \`gh pr create --repo ${REPO} --base main --head auto/issue-${b.n} --title "<concise>" --body "${closesLine(b)}\\n\\n<what + how + gate counts + reachability>"\` — only an HONEST closes list (if you delivered N of M deliverables, drop the unearned Closes and say so).
9. SCOPE OVERFLOW: if the work revealed anything BEYOND ${closesList(b).map((x) => "#" + x).join("/")} (hidden coupling, a missing prerequisite, an under-sized issue, obvious adjacent follow-ups), record it in \`scopeNotes\` — do NOT grow this PR to cover it.

READ-ONLY MANDATE: you have NO worktree — your shell cwd is the USER'S LIVE session worktree; NEVER run \`gh pr checkout\`, \`git checkout\`, \`git reset\`, \`git stash\`, or ANY state-mutating git command anywhere (a reviewer that checked out a PR branch in the user's worktree hijacked their live session). Inspect via \`gh pr diff\`/\`gh api\`/\`gh pr view\` and Read files at their committed paths; if you must run code, clone/fetch into a fresh dir under /tmp.
DO: \`gh pr diff ${build.pr} --repo ${REPO}\` + read changed files in context. Judge: correct + COMPLETE for #${b.n}? Actually REACHABLE/wired (not dead code)? In scope (no unrelated churn)? Conventions + house rules honored (no invented tokens)? Bugs / missing tests / regressions? Gate genuinely green? Decide approve | changes (list SPECIFIC actionable fixes) | reject (fundamentally wrong). Default to "changes" if materially off.
DISCIPLINE: every \`findings\` entry must be a REAL, actionable fix to THIS PR's diff — never placeholders. If your only material notes are follow-up scope (work outside this PR's fence), the decision is "approve" and those notes go in \`scopeGaps\`; "changes" with an empty/junk findings list wastes a fix-agent run.
If your decision is "changes", ALSO post the findings as ONE comment on the PR (\`gh pr comment ${build.pr} --repo ${REPO} --body "…"\`) so the record exists on the live PR — commenting is allowed under the read-only mandate; git state mutation is not.
