## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 5431d8e: Clickable value-list picker. A value-list argument (a semantic type with a
  declared `values` list) now renders an interactive chip instead of a passive
  label: click it to open a filterable dropdown of the items and rewrite the
  literal in place. Hosts get a click-to-pick combobox for free from a declared
  value-list — no custom `ArgumentWidget` required (#224).

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 9ce2764: Fix host-widget Edit on non-string arguments. A host `ArgumentWidget` on a
  non-string semantic type (e.g. an `int`) opened and called `host.resolve(...)`
  but never wrote back when replacing an existing literal — the in-place edit
  resolved the literal range with a quote-only finder, so a bare literal like `1`
  was a silent no-op. Bare int/float/bool literals are now handled, so host
  widgets can edit already-filled arguments of any type (#242).

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 05325c0: Argument-widget + editor polish.

  - **Bundle the editor font** — the studio now self-hosts JetBrains Mono
    (Latin, regular/bold/italic), so embedders without it installed (e.g. RPG
    Maker MZ / NW.js) no longer fall back to the system monospace.
  - **Typed widgets in the Host Functions panel** — composing a fresh call from
    the panel now uses the same value-list dropdowns, host widgets, and
    arg-group controls as the in-editor call Form, not plain text fields.
  - **Host-sourced value-lists in the Form** — a slot whose semantic type
    declares `values: host` now surfaces its dropdown items from the pushed host
    cache, not just static manifest items.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- facc579: Argument-widget fixes.

  - **Embedded host content theming/positioning** — widget popovers (the color
    picker, host pickers, the call Form) now mount inside the `.brink-studio` root
    and use `position: fixed`, so embedded host content inherits the theme tokens
    and positions correctly when the studio is embedded in a host page (rather than
    rendering unstyled or mis-placed against `document.body`).
  - **Auto-open on completion-accept** — the completion kind map was keyed by the
    wrong casing, so every completion was typed `"text"`. This both mis-iconed
    completions and disabled "open the Form when accepting a function completion".
  - **The call Form is driven by the signature metadata**, not the live call-site,
    so a partial or over-full call still renders its declared widgets (e.g. an
    arg-group picker) instead of degrading to plain text fields; Apply writes a
    well-formed call.

  - @brink-lang/web@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 755868c: Argument widgets — rich, type-driven call-site authoring.

  - A whole-call **Form** that renders one control per argument, chosen by the
    argument's type: a text input, the built-in color picker, a host-declared
    **value-list dropdown**, or a host **custom widget** — including **arg-groups**
    (one widget over several parameters, e.g. a 2D point picker) whose editor
    embeds inline. The Form holds live draft state, so an arg-group's inter-arg
    context resolves from the current form (pick a map, then a spot on that map)
    before anything is written.
  - **Inline editing** of typed arguments in the editor: color swatches,
    value-list name labels, host-rendered chips, and arg-group chips — Edit a
    filled literal, Fill an empty slot, or open the Form (an opt-in inline glyph,
    the always-on hover-card action, the `Mod-Shift-A` keybind, or the Host
    Functions panel).
  - A host **argument-widget API** (`StudioExtensions.argumentWidgets`): built-in
    and host-provided widgets, popover/modal editor surfaces, and arg-group
    widgets that receive resolved inter-arg context.
  - The `argument_widgets` IDE query now reports per-slot value-list items and
    per-group inter-arg context indices across the wasm boundary, so the studio
    can render dropdowns and resolve context from live form state.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bcd23b7: Live inspector and host-aware authoring.

  - The story session is driven by a `SessionProvider`, so the transcript, State
    View, and Story Graph render against a provider rather than the wasm runner
    directly — the groundwork for inspecting a VM running in a host.
  - Capability-gated session commands, program-identity degraded mode, and
    multi-session support (independent runners + shared-context flows) with a
    session/flow picker.
  - A host-aware argument picker: a value dropdown and inline value labels for
    `EXTERNAL` arguments whose semantic type declares a value source (static, or
    pushed live by a host), plus a `StudioExtensions.argumentProviders` surface
    for embedders to supply those values.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6276f29: File-content egress for embedding hosts (#154, closing #137): a debounced,
  batched `onFilesChanged(changes: FileChange[])` mount option fed by every
  mutation path (editor edits, binder structural ops, search replace,
  `file.new`), an `api.getFiles()` / `api.getDirtyFiles()` pull surface,
  `file.save` (Mod-S) / `file.saveAll` commands that flush and deliver
  immediately, and a `dirtyFiles` count on `StudioPublicState` (additive —
  `version` stays 1). Also: a `wasmLocation` mount option forwarded to
  `initWasm` for IIFE-plugin hosts, and a Chromium-88 `adoptedStyleSheets`
  feature-detect shim in the mount bootstrap (NW.js / RPG Maker MZ).
