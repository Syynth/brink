Fold kinds (#365): `FoldRange` now carries a `kind: "structural" | "machinery" | "narrative"`.

- **`structural`** — everything the folding pass emitted before #365 (knot/stitch declarations, doc comments, conditionals, sequences, choice sets, the INCLUDE-block fold). User-invoked in every mode; never auto-collapsed.
- **`machinery`** — a maximal run of `>= 2` consecutive machinery-natured lines (logic `~`, VAR/CONST/LIST decls, standalone diverts, conditional/sequence scaffold lines). Run-based over the per-line classification (base, or a registered dialect's declared `nature`, #368) — never HIR-block-based, so a narrative-bearing conditional's scaffold lines don't drag its prose branches into a machinery fold.
- **`narrative`** — the symmetric run of `>= 2` consecutive narrative-natured lines (plain prose, or dialect kinds like `character`/`parenthetical`/`dialogue`).

Editor-side (`@brink-lang/editor`):
- `foldingExtension` takes a live-reconfigurable **active-kinds set** (default: all three); `setActiveFoldKinds(view, kinds)` reconfigures a mounted view.
- New exported commands `foldAllOfKind(kind)` / `unfoldAllOfKind(kind)` — bulk fold/unfold every current range of one kind. Mode auto-collapse is always **host-invoked** (call these on your own mode-entry hook); the extension itself never forces a collapse.
- Machinery/narrative folds render a JetBrains-style summary pill instead of the generic `…` placeholder: `brink-fold-pill` + `brink-fold-pill-machinery`/`brink-fold-pill-narrative` + `brink-fold-pill-icon`/`brink-fold-pill-summary`/`brink-fold-pill-count` child spans — class-addressable, zero inline styles. The machinery pill summarizes salient calls/assignments/divert targets (capped at 2, "+N more"); the narrative pill shows a first-line snippet, cast (via the registered dialect's carried `speaker` attribute — not a re-hardcoded `characterName()`), and line count.
- The existing declaration fold placeholder (`.brink-fold-decl`) now carries `data-decl-kind="knot" | "stitch" | "function"` plus a `.brink-fold-decl-icon` slot span.

`brink_ir::ElementNature` (narrative/machinery/structural) and `ResolvedDialect::nature_of` are new in the Rust dialect schema, consumed by `brink-ide::folding::machinery_and_narrative_folds` — never re-hardcoding a kind list in Rust or TS.
