Add `StoryRunnerHandle.goToPath(path)` — ink's `ChoosePathString` equivalent. Moves the play head to a named knot or stitch (`"knot"` / `"knot.stitch"`); subsequent `continue*` calls run from there. The session keeps its state: variables and visit/turn counts survive, and the jump itself counts as a visit to the target, exactly like a `-> path` divert. Pending choices are abandoned (callstack reset); the transcript so far is kept. Throws on an unknown path (naming it), and refuses to jump while the story is parked on an unresolved async external — resolve it (or `reset()`) first.
