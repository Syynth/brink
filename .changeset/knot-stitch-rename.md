Knot/stitch **Rename** — a full, cross-file, safe-by-default rename on the shared symbol context menu (editor / Binder / Story Graph) and the editor's **F2**. A clean rename applies immediately; one that would introduce diagnostics flips to an in-place breakage report whose only override is an explicit **Force rename** (mirroring the `brink ide rename` CLI's `--unsafe` gate). An open symbol-view tab survives its own rename (re-keyed in place).

F2 is now a full cross-file rename — the previous single-file F2 was a bug. `@brink-lang/web` gains `rename_symbol` / `rename_symbol_at` and drops the superseded `rename_doc` / `rename` exports (and the corresponding `doRename` handle methods).
